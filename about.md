This is my blog dedicated primarily to replicating and reimagining older research papers in economics, but other stuff will pop up occasionally. I try to first replicate papers, primarily using Rmarkdown documents to describe replication steps. Then, I seek to extend papers using modern, interactive tools such as Shiny, Plotly and Crosstalk as well as potentially introduce contemporary data to the models. Finally, I apply some more modern econometric/statistical techniques that may not have been available at the time of the original paper's publication.


I'm currently a Master's student at the London School of Economics and can be contacted via email at E.M.Jee@lse.ac.uk.
