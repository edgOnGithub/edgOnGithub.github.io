This is my website containing random assortments of vaguely economics related posts. 

I'm currently a graduate student in the Economics Department at UChicago, before this I was a pre-doc for Professor Melissa Dell and an undergraduate/MSc student at LSE. My GitHub account can be found [here](https://github.com/EdJeeOnGitHub) and I can be reached at edjee@uchicago.edu.
