This is my blog dedicated to replicating and reimagining older research papers in economics.

- My aim is first to replicate papers, primarily using Rmarkdown documents to describe replication steps.
- Then, I seek to extend papers using modern, interactive tools such as Shiny, Plotly and Leaflet as well as introduce contemporary data to the models. 
- Finally, I apply some more modern econometric techniques that may not have been available at the original paper's publication.


I'm currently a student at the London School of Economics.
