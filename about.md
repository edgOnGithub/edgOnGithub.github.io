This is my blog dedicated to replicating and reimagining older research papers in economics. My aim is first to replicate papers, primarily using Rmarkdown documents to describe replication steps, then extend papers using modern, interactive tools such as Shiny, Plotly and Leaflet as well as introduce contemporary data to the models and finally apply some more modern econometric techniques to check for modelling sensitivity etc.
