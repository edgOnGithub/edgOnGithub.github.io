This is my blog dedicated primarily to replicating and reimagining older research papers in economics, but other stuff will pop up occasionally.

I try to first replicate papers, primarily using Rmarkdown documents to describe replication steps. Then, I seek to extend papers using modern, interactive tools such as Shiny, Plotly and Crosstalk as well as potentially introduce contemporary data to the models. Finally, I apply some more modern econometric/statistical techniques that may not have been available at the time of the original paper's publication.


I'm currently a Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow in the Economics Department at Harvard working under Professor Melissa Dell. I can be contacted via my LSE email address at E.M.Jee@lse.ac.uk (where I was previously an undergraduate and MSc student) and my GitHub account can be found [here](https://github.com/EdJeeOnGitHub).
